  <h1>This is a site all about my cat <strong>Drew</strong></h1>
  <h2>Here is a short history of how I met Drew</h2>

  <p>In Febuary 2021, my girlfriend finally convinced me to get a cat. She found very nice people online who were selling kittens. 
    Drew was the only kitten who woke up from their nap and to say hi. We brought him home with us and have loved him ever since.
  </p>

  <p>Here are some of Drew's <em>FAVORITE </em>things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Going on long walks in his backpack or stroller
